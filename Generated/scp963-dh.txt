One SCP-963-2 inside of the surveillance devices in particular has unusual properties, informed their superiors. When in rut, rams will fight with each other on the device. D-937122 attacked Foundation personnel suggest the mutations are random, analysis of the structure. Should the subject refuses, or terminates the connection is available.

SCP-963 was recovered from Prometheus Labs, SCP-963 was used to track SCP-963 where they should be bursting like that. Specific details vary between those points.

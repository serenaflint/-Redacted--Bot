Addendum 103-b: On █/██/████, Dr. █████ speculates that tolerance of SCP-104 by the subject's arm showed the bulk of SCP-104-X items as occurring entirely and exclusively within SCP-104.

This transformation involves said instance seemingly dissolving into the fetal position 1.3 meters below the rib cage.

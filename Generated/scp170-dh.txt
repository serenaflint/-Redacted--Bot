SCP-170 is kept in a standard containment cell would injure it enough to prevent accidental exposure to the potential risk resulting from its new location and target are to be placed over SCP-170 when not being studied. If this occurs, authorized technical staff are to be maintained in open ocean, due to dangers posed by high precision laser rangefinders. No instances of SCP-170 are to be immediately removed from containment. Based on prior research, it is to be handed back to acceptable levels. 

Description: As an odd side effect, SCP-170 receives the injuries they did not recognize itself in reality. Figure B: SCP-170-1; Enhanced image from paper, photopaper, even from original samples.
